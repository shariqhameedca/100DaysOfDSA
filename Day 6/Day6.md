# ðŸŽ‰ Day 6: Sorting I ðŸŽ‰
## Sorting:
Sorting an array means to put the elements present in an ascending (or descending) order.
<br>
On my day 6th of #100daysofdsa challenge, I explored different sorting techniques
<br><br>Particularly, I covered the following:
1. ### Bubble Sort:
   Bubble sort works by comparing adjacent elements and if element i is greater than i+1, they get swapped.
  <br><b>Time complexity:</b> O(nÂ²) in worst case while O(n) in best case
  
2. ### Selection Sort.
   Selection sort works by going from i to n-1 and selecting the minimum and putting it at ith position. It "selects" the minimum.
   <br><b>Time complexity:</b> O(nÂ²) in worst case and best case
5. ### Insertion sort:
   Insertion sort works by taking an element and inserting it at its correct position.
   <br><b>Time complexity:</b> O(nÂ²) in worst case and O(n) in best case

<br>Take a look at the codes for practice.
