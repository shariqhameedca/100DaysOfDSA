# ðŸŽ‰ Day 4: Recursion and basic problems using recursion ðŸŽ‰

On the 4th day of my #100DaysOfDSA challenge, I covered recursion and the basic problems relating to recursion.
## Recursion:
Recursion is the process of calling a function within a function until a base condition is met.
<br><br>
I learned about stack overflow, call stack and also auxiliary space.
<br><br>
Then I solved basic questions relating to recursion like:
1. Print numbers from 1 to n
2. Print numbers from n to 1
3. Factorial using functional and parameterized recursion
4. Sum first n numbers using functional and parameterized recursion
5. Print a name N times
6. Reverse Array
<br>
In this directory, I have shared all the code files for the problems I solved using recursion.
<br>
<b>Note: These problems are quite basic. Over the course of the next 100 days I will solve and add complex problems using recursion. </b>
<br><br>

Checkout the codes for practice.
