# ðŸŽ‰ Day 8: Array Problems [EASY] ðŸŽ‰

On the 8th day of my #100DaysOfDSA challenge, I solved different array questions from the easy class.
<br><br>
Following are the problems and the corresponding time and space complexities of my solutions.
### 1. Find the largest element in an array:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1)<br>

### 2. Find the second largest element in an array:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1)<br>

### 3. Find the second smallest element in an array:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1)<br>

### 4. Check if an array is sorted:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1)<br>

### 5. Count unique elements in an array:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1)<br>

Checkout the codes for practice.
