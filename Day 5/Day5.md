# ðŸŽ‰ Day 5: Hashing Theory ðŸŽ‰

On the 5th day of my #100DaysOfDSA challenge, I covered the theoritical concepts behind hashing.
<br><br>
Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. I covered hashmaps. In python, they are called dictionaries. 
<br><br>
In this directory, I have shared all the code files for the problems I solved related to hashing.
<br><br>
Following are the problems that I solved:

1. Creating a hashed array for an input array
2. Creating a hashed array for an input string array
3. Count frequency of each element in an array
4. Find the lowest/highest frequency element

Checkout the codes for practice.
