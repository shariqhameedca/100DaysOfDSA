ðŸŽ‰ Day 10: Array Problems [EASY] ðŸŽ‰
On the 10th day of my #100DaysOfDSA challenge, I solved different array questions from the easy class.

Following are the problems and the corresponding time and space complexities of my solutions.

1. Find missing number:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Maximum Consecutive 1's count:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Checkout the codes for practice.
