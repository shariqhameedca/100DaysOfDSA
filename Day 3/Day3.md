# ðŸŽ‰ Day 3: Solving Problems Using Basic Mathematics ðŸŽ‰

On the 3rd day of my #100DaysOfDSA challenge, I covered basic mathematical concepts that help in solving many DSA problems. 
<br><br>
In this directory, I have shared all the code files for the problems I solved using the basic mathematical concepts. 
<br><br>
Following are the problems that I solved:

1. Extract digits from a number
2. Count the number of digits in a number
3. Reverse a number
4. Print divisors of a number
5. Check if a number is prime number
6. Check if a number is armstrong
7. Check if a number is palindrome
8. Find Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

Checkout the codes for practice.
