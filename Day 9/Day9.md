# ðŸŽ‰ Day 9: Array Problems [EASY] ðŸŽ‰

On the 9th day of my #100DaysOfDSA challenge, I solved different array questions from the easy class.
<br><br>
Following are the problems and the corresponding time and space complexities of my solutions.
### 1. Left rotate an array by 1 place:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1)<br>

### 2. Left rotate an array by d places:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n+d)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(d)<br>

### 3. Linear Search:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1)<br>

### 4. Move zeros to the right:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1)<br>

### 5. Finding union of two arrays:
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n1 + n2)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(n1 + n2)<br>

Checkout the codes for practice.
