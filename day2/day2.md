# ðŸŽ‰ Day 2: Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ ðŸŽ‰

C++ has been a widely popular high-level programming language used extensively by developers for many years, earning affection from programmers, particularly those in competitive programming circles, due to its efficient execution speed.

STL, short for Standard Template Library, is a distinguishing feature of C++, setting it apart from other programming languages. The STL encompasses an array of pre-defined templates in the form of containers and classes, simplifying the implementation of various data structures. This saves developers from having to write exhaustive code and relieves concerns about space-time complexities.

On my day 2 of #100daysofdsa challenge, I explored STL.
Particularly, I covered the following:
1. Vector
2. Pairs
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Priority queue
6. Deque
7. List
8. Map
9. Multimap
10. Set
11. Unordered set
12. Multiset
13. Unordered map
14. Unordered multimap

Here's a good resource to study these:
