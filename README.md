# 100DaysOfDSA
Welcome to my 100 Days of DSA repository! ðŸš€

Introduction
In this repository, I will document my journey to learn Data Structures and Algorithms in 100 days. In these 100 days, I will learn a concept, solve a problem or write an article on medium every day, and share it with you people here. The solved problems will be ranging from easy to very hard problems. 

Motivation
The main objective of this challenge is to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of coding concepts, and ultimately become a better programmer. By dedicating time each day to tackle coding problems, I aim to refine my ability to analyze and break down problems, while also exploring different algorithms and data structures to improve my coding efficiency.

Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

/dayX: Each day's code solution will be placed in a separate folder, labeled as "day-X" where "X" represents the day number of the challenge.
/dayX/problem.md: This file contains the problem statement for the respective day's coding challenge.
/dayX/solution.py: Here, you will find my solution to the coding problem in the form of a Python script.
Join Me on this Journey
I invite all fellow coding enthusiasts, developers, and learners to join me on this coding journey. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, your participation and support are highly appreciated. Let's learn from each other, inspire one another, and grow together as a community of passionate programmers.

If you're interested in contributing to this repository, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Contributions, improvements, and alternative solutions are always welcome!

Let's Connect
I'm excited to share my progress with you throughout this challenge. Connect with me on LinkedIn (Shariq Hameed) to stay updated on my daily coding solutions and engage in insightful discussions.

Let's make the next 100 days count and embark on an incredible coding adventure together! ðŸš€
