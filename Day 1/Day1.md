# 🎉 Day 1: Algorithmic Complexity: Time Complexity and Space Complexity 🎉
On my very first day of #100daysofdsa challenge, I learned about algorithmic complexity.

I learned approaches to estimate the complexity of an algorithm and why some approaches do not work well. I explored time and space complexities and how to calculate them for a given piece of code.

I then explored cases where we have to strike a balance between time and space complexity.

I summarized my learning in a medium post shared on my profile.
